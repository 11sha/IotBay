    WARRANTY
    
     • All products sold by IoTBay carry a full manufacturer warranty. IoTBay will process all warranty claims with the manufacturer on behalf of customers unless the manufacturer has a direct warranty option to the customer. Some products do offer an extended limited warranty which customers may require registration with the manufacturer. In the event of a manufacturer or supplier closure, we will endeavour to fulfil our warranty commitments however we can not guarantee the outcome.
    
    • Any product returned for a warranty claim, depending on its age and availability, will generally be repaired, replaced with new or refurbished, upgraded or refunded by the manufacturers.
    
    • Manufacturers offering lifetime warranty refer to the lifetime of the product (assuming the product is still available from the manufacturer) unless specified otherwise. In the event that the product becomes obsolete, it may be upgraded to a similar product or a credit will be given at the current market value or purchased price whichever is lower; however the outcome is entirely dependent on each manufacturer’s policy.
    
    • IoTBay do not handle warranty returns for products that already provide a local or direct manufacturer to customer warranty service. These products include printers, scanners, networking products and monitors and many other retail products. Please read the manufacturer’s warranty terms and conditions for the specific details. Please look at the forum link on our website  for a detailed manufacturer technical support contact number listing here: Manufacturer Contact Page.
    
    • Warranty is provided solely on products sold by IoTBay. Other faulty products used in conjunction that are not purchased from IoTBay will not be covered under warranty.
    
    • Any product sold by IoTBay is meant to be professionally installed; improper installation is NOT covered under warranty. Please seek a professional assistance if required, to avoid paying any unnecessary cost for replacement or repair.
    
    • IoTBay will also apply a Tamper Proof warranty sticker to the back of the case in every system built. This is done as part of our Quality Control. It is not used to prevent customers from accessing the inside of their computer in the future. Removal of this warranty sticker will only void any claims of loss, incomplete, damaged hardware, or incorrectly installed hardware in a system upon arrival. Customers should be able to verify their computer components in the system thru software without opening up the case. When a IoTBay system is deemed faulty or contain incorrect configuration we require that systems be returned to us with the warranty sticker still attached to ensure there has been no tampering. By removing this sticker customer will also accept to pay for any labour/courier costs associated with future warranty claims of the system.
    
    • IoTBay does NOT cover any software installation issues e.g. drivers or system software updates for any computer where IoTBay did not install the software originally. Should any warranty claims arise where software is at fault, installed by the customer, standard charges will apply.
    
    • IoTBay will NOT be liable in any way for incidental, consequential or indirect loss resulting from faulty systems or parts. IoTBay is not responsible for any data loss; backing up of data is the responsibility of the customer. IoTBay does not provide a backup or data recovery service when sending hard disks for warranty claims. Hard drives sent for warranty are always replaced with a new/refurbished unit.
    
    • Warranty will be void for any non-manufacturing defects, if the item is found to be mishandled, modified, tampered, abused, physically damaged, improperly installed and used, or damaged caused by power surges, electrical faults and lightning strikes. Products returned that show evidence of user induced damage, overclocking, tampering or modification, will be denied. This includes improper installation of the CPU heatsink, scratches on motherboard, failure of fan/heatsink, cutting of cables or the soldering of components.
    
    • Under the Return to Base warranty policy, all shipping charges for any product returned to IoTBay incurred in a warranty claim will be at the expense of the customer. IoTBay will only pay for the return freight to the customer, except for rejected warranty, non faulty returns or bulky items older than 6 months from date of invoice.
    
    • Warranty must be properly packaged in the condition acceptable by the vendor. (please provide original packaging if possible or adequate safe packaging as insufficient safe packaging that caused physical damage will result in warranty being voided)
    
    • Turnaround time for warranty returns may depend on the availability of the replacement product from manufacturer. The process of warranty returns involves the shipping of warranty to IoTBay, product testing time, obtaining approval from the supplier, the shipping of warranty to our supplier, supplier's own testing, shipment back to us, testing of the part if its a repaired item, and finally shipment back to the end user.
    
    • A large percentage of warranty returns are tested to be without fault. In the event the product is not faulty, IoTBay reserves the right to charge a maximum labour fee of $50 per product for time spent on testing the product.
    
    • IoTBay will not be responsible for keeping any warranty returns that are unclaimed or have not been picked up for more than 3 months. Customer must always leave a valid contact detail for warranty.
